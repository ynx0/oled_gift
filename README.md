# oled_gift

This repository holds the code for an oled display that was part of a birthday gift for a friend, @berkott. The code is really messy, but it was done in <2 days and kinda rushed so you gotta cut me some slack, jack. 

Anywho, I'm probably gonna still work on it a bit more anyway in order to bring it to bring it closer to my original vision of the product.
